### 3fT - api talker (synced to _point_12 last version)

INFO:
- _client.js is a total mess :) - hope you understand
- also not included login in requests to stop script kiddos
- in globals.js you can find all global data, variables and requirements (for new files to include just add them there and use `require('./globals.js');`)
- utility.js holds only save json to file and sleep (wait) in application described by miliseconds
- _launcher.js holds all launcher links and i made only 2 of them working to make sure im always at newest launcher/server version


how to run ?? its simple `node NikitaSux.js` in CMD


_[note] why im sharing this ?? Cause i found better way to dump all data from their game :)_
